What is and why important?
Encapsulation is not always data hiding, but data hiding is always a form of encapsulation. Variables make up the data in a class and unction perform tasks using that data. The bundling of these two aspects is called encapsulation. This is important because it makes the class self contained. 
Data hiding enables (encapsulated) sections of a program to hide its data from other sections. This is important because it allows these sections to enforce the integrity of their data. 

The example shows data hiding because width and heigth are hidden for the user. If they want to change it is only possible by using a member of the class. It is a form of encapsulation because both the functions and the data are in one class.
