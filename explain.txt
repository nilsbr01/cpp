1. What differences exist between pointer variables and arrays; 
2. What differences exist between pointer variables and reference variables; 
3. How element [3][2] is reached (make a clear drawing) 
4. What is meant by `pointer arithmetic';
5. Explain why accessing an element in an array using only a pointer variable is preferred over using an index expression. By implication: why are repetitions iterating over a series of elements using a pointer-type loop control variable preferred over repetitions in which the loop control variable is, e.g., a size_t type variable?
