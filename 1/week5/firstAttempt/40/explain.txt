1. What differences exist between pointer variables and arrays?
A pointer is a variable which points to a place in the memory. An array is an addres in the memory where one or more variables are (of the same type).

2. What differences exist between pointers variables and reference variables?
A pointer point to a specific point in the memory whereas a references to a specific object/variable.

3. How element [3][2] is reached:
a. for the variable 'int array [20][30]'
b. for the variable 'int *pointer[20]'

4. What is meant by 'pointer arithmetic'
That you can perform certain mathematical operations with pointers. For example adding substracting pointer to know the distance between them in the memory.

5. Explain why accessing an element in an array using only a pointer variable is preferred over using an index expression
It will increase the efficiency of the program. When we use an index expression the computer has to look every time for the next element which is used in the array. A pointer points directly to the place in the memory.
